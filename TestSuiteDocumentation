Test Suite Documentation for testing demo program and associated files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Testing script is located in tests/suitescript.sh

   ->the tests directory also contains the following test files:
   ->testCmds which tests demo program response to:
   	      -Valid Commands.
	      
	      -Invalid Commands.
	      
	      -Toggling Verbose/Quiet mode.
	      
   ->Expected Results:
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ->testFunc which tests demo program functionality:
   	      -Test for duplicate insertions.
	      
	      -Printing quads and trees for empty, one level and multiple levels.
	      
	      -Find testing in both trees and quads where item exists and does not.
	      
	      -Quit testing where no tree is created, a tree is created but not
	      deleted and tree has been created and deleted.

	      -New testing where there is already a valid tree and where there
	      is not a valid tree.

	      -Testing for items that have 0-length addresses, 1-length addresses
	      and max-length addresses.

	      -Testing for inserts of invalid addresses:
	      invalid length.
	      contains invalid characters.
	      lower left coroner is actually not lower or left of upper right
	      corner.

    ->testAll which tests the testCmds and testFunc togeather.

2) suitescript.sh takes 1 arguments: ex. ./suitescript.sh testAll

   -> testCmds: will test the demo responce to command input.
   -> testFunc: will test the demo program functionality
   -> testAll: runs all tests togeather

3) suitescript.sh counts all passed/failed tests and pipes test output results
   to a file called testResults.
